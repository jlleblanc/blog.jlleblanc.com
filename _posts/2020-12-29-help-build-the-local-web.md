title:  "Help Build the Local Web"
---
I need your help.

If you know anything about me, you know that I’m a coder. One of the quirks of being a coder is that whenever I see a problem, I want to grab my laptop and start writing software.

The older I get, the more I realize the hardest challenges with technology are not about devices, networks, and software. The hardest challenges are about the social contracts and expectations we have around using technology.

The World Wide Web set out to become a decentralized publishing platform, which it largely is. However, it has been superseded by centrally-controlled, corporate-owned social media platforms. Social media now drives the Internet and heavily influences how we use it. Official and unofficial rules of social media determine what we can post, how we can communicate, and even how we define our relationships. Even worse, “viral” content shared in an unclear, global context has amplified misinformation and disinformation. 

If you live in the United States, add up what you and your household are paying for broadband Internet and cellphones. Your total is likely upwards of $150 per month. For all of that money, you gain access to a social media world where algorithms are used to track your behavior and sell your personal data.

We deserve much better. We deserve a high-trust, non-corporate, algorithm-free, person-centric local web where the context in which we are communicating is known.
## This is where your help comes in

If I try to do this on my own, not only will I get lost wandering through technical details, I will get burnt out. But I am convinced that with your help, we can build the Local Web. We can start by talking about these topics:

* How we should be able to use technology to communicate with people we know and trust
* Experiences we’ve had (positive and negative) using social media
* What we know we could do if we didn’t always have to go through Facebook, Google, and Twitter
* How we can ensure people, not algorithm-driven profiteering, will always be first

You do not need to be a coder to join this effort. While people may be writing code at some point, we will be focusing more on “what could be” than “what we can code today.”

## How you can get involved
I have a Slack group ready to aid our efforts. If you are unfamiliar with Slack, I would be happy to introduce it to you. There are Slack apps available for both your mobile device and your desktop.

Beyond this Slack group, I currently have a workshop proposal for MozFest 2021, which will occur in March. Decisions on proposed sessions will be made soon and there is the possibility that mine will not be selected. Regardless of whether the session is selected, I would like to prepare for this workshop to be run multiple times. With your help, I’ll be able to ask better questions and run better workshops.

You can be as involved in the project as you would like. At a minimum, I will have an introductory, open-ended question: what does “local” look like when the Internet is available worldwide?

If this at all interests you, please [send me a message](mailto:contact@jlleblanc.com?subject=Interested%20in%20building%20the%20Local%20Web). If you are not necessarily interested but know of someone who would be, please pass this post along to them!
