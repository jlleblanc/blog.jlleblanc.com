![A beautiful sunset the photo doesn't do justice. A range from red, to peach, to yellow, to indigo, to purple.]({{ site.url }}/assets/article_images/AE233975-244D-4BB6-BD80-B96D638DD0AB.jpeg)

I was flying back from California a while ago and snapped this picture from my window seat. The light outside had this unreal quality and I knew that a photo wasn't going to turn out, but decided to take one anyway. Tried pulling this into Procreate to paint with the colors, but I wasn't sure where I was going with it, so I stopped.
